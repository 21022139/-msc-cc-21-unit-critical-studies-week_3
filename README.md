If we went back five hundred years, I believe that all the infrastructure we could use or interact with would be visual, i.e. through virtual reality technology, because the purpose of technological development has always been to make people's lives easier by allowing them to experience almost all public facilities, but perhaps not physical needs such as food and sports, without having to leave their homes. People have always had a thirst for knowledge, so I believe that in the future, both the government and the private sector will pump a lot of money into building libraries. The library of the future will be a small program installed in your
microcomputer (a microcomputer that can be worn like a contact lens on your pupil, projecting data and images onto the retina, controlled by the nervous system), which both able-bodied and disabled people can access at any time and from anywhere by downloading different databases. This is how copyright owners and libraries (databases) make money because the copyright still exists, so readers cannot access all the books in one database. In the future, I believe physical libraries will still exist because there will always be patrons who stick to the paper product and we will still be able to use the database applications installed on our microcomputers to find out which physical library the book we want is in and make a reservation.

This is how I imagine libraries will work in the future ......
